## Panda Express Website

Using react, express.js, and PostgreSQL, my team and I developed a publically hosted website for Panda Express customers to order online, as well as on in-store kiosks. The ability for cashiers to take and manage orders. As well as for managers to be able to view store reports, manage employees, view and restock the inventory, and manage the menu. Our product also fully complies with WCAG 2.1. The link to the website, as well as the link to the github repo are as follows:
